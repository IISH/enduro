> Enduro brings endurance to Archivematica-based preservation workflows.

Enduro is a proof of concept. It aims to provide a tool to orchestrate reliable
workflows where multi-pipeline [Archivematica][archivematica] deployments are integrated with other systems.

It could be seen as a replacement for [automation-tools][automation-tools], but
it is also a new space for experimentation and research to build a distributed
system that enables users to run failure-oblivious and durable preservation
workflows.
